  - Increase context window for multi-document questions
  - Document relationship mapping
- [ ] **Performance Optimizations**
  - Implement true streaming at LLM level
  - Reduce timeout issues with better chunking
  - Parallel processing for multi-document queries
  - Smart caching of common queries
